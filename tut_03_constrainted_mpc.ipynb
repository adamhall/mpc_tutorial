Remeber, from Tutorial 01, the optimization problem looks like the following, but we have replced $\\mathcal{X}$ with the constrained state set $\\mathbb{X}$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ with the constrained input set $\\mathbb{U}$.\n",

    "The most comman way to represent constraint sets are as convex polyhedral regions given by linear matriex inequalities, i.e., $\\mathbb{X} = \\{x\\in\\mathcal{X} | H_i x + h_i \\leq 0, \\forall i=0\\ldots...N_{h}\\}$ and $\\mathbb{U} = \\{u\\in\\mathcal{U} | G_i u + g_i \\leq 0, \\forall i=0\\ldots...N_{g}\\}$. The reason for this is that it allows for a large variety of region shapes while maintaining convexity of the optimization problem. Convex optimization problems are much easier to solve than nonconvex optimization problems, and thus maintaining convexity is important.\n",
